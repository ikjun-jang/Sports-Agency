# Sports Agency API - Backend

## Introduction
The Sports Agency models a company that creates partnerships with sports clubs and players, whose responsibility is to make contracts between their players and clubs. As an executive director within the company, you can perform every action needed to manage both players and clubs while a contract manager or an assistant can only perform specified actions that their authorities allow.

### Installing Dependencies - Local Backend

1. **Python 3.9** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)


2. **Virtual Enviornment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)


3. **Environment Variables Setup** - set up the environment variables as:
```bash
source setup.sh
```

4. **PIP Dependencies** - Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.


5. **Key Dependencies**
 - [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

 - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

 - [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

### Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the agency.psql file provided. In terminal run:
```bash
psql -d agency -U postgres -a -f agency.psql
```

### Running the server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

### API Server URL
- `https://agent369.herokuapp.com/`
